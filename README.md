📚 **Course Project:** Data Structures  
🏫 **University Project (2022)**  

---

## 📖 Project Overview
This project simulates a **patient management system** for a medical facility.  
It is implemented using a **singly linked list** in C++.  

The system allows clerks to manage patient records efficiently by performing essential operations such as insertion, deletion, updating, searching, and invoice management.

## 🔹 Features
The system supports the following operations:

- **Insert Patient Record** → Add a new patient at the end of the list.  
- **Delete Patient Record** → Remove a patient record by ID.  
- **Update Patient Record** → Modify patient details (name, address, phone, invoice, or all data).  
- **Show Patient Records** → Display a single record or all patient records.  
- **Search Patient Record** → Search by patient ID.  
- **Invoice Management** →  
  - Add **15% VAT** to invoices greater than 100 SR.  
  - Delete invoices less than 10 SR.

- Name  
- ID (Unique identifier)  
- Phone number  
- Address  
- Invoice amount

## 🛠️ Implementation Details
- Implemented using **Linked Lists** in **C++**.  
- Each patient is represented as a `Node` in the linked list.  
- ID is used as the **unique key** to avoid duplicate records.  
- All inputs are entered by the user via command-line interface.
